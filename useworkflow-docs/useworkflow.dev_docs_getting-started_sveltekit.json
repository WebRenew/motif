This command will create a new directory named `my-workflow-app` with a minimal setup and setup a SvelteKit project inside it.\n\n```\nnpx sv create my-workflow-app --template=minimal --types=ts --no-add-ons\n```\n\nEnter the newly made directory:\n\n```\ncd my-workflow-app\n```\n\n### [Install `workflow`](https://useworkflow.dev/docs/getting-started/sveltekit\\#install-workflow)\n\nnpm\n\npnpm\n\nyarn\n\nbun\n\n```\nnpm i workflow\n```\n\n### [Configure Vite](https://useworkflow.dev/docs/getting-started/sveltekit\\#configure-vite)\n\nAdd `workflowPlugin()` to your Vite config. This enables usage of the `\"use workflow\"` and `\"use step\"` directives.\n\nvite.config.ts\n\n```\n\n```\n\n### \\#\\#\\# [Setup IntelliSense for TypeScript (Optional)](https://useworkflow.dev/docs/getting-started/sveltekit\\\\#setup-intellisense-for-typescript-optional)\n\n## [Create Your First Workflow](https://useworkflow.dev/docs/getting-started/sveltekit\\#create-your-first-workflow)\n\nCreate a new file for our first workflow:\n\nworkflows/user-signup.ts\n\n```\n\n```\n\nWe'll fill in those functions next, but let's take a look at this code:\n\n- We define a **workflow** function with the directive `\"use workflow\"`. Think of the workflow function as the _orchestrator_ of individual **steps**.\n- The Workflow DevKit's `sleep` function allows us to suspend execution of the workflow without using up any resources. A sleep can be a few seconds, hours, days, or even months long.\n\n## [Create Your Workflow Steps](https://useworkflow.dev/docs/getting-started/sveltekit\\#create-your-workflow-steps)\n\nLet's now define those missing functions.\n\nworkflows/user-signup.ts\n\n```\n\n```\n\nTaking a look at this code:\n\n- Business logic lives inside **steps**. When a step is invoked inside a **workflow**, it gets enqueued to run on a separate request while the workflow is suspended, just like `sleep`.\n- If a step throws an error, like in `sendWelcomeEmail`, the step will automatically be retried until it succeeds (or hits the step's max retry count).\n- Steps can throw a `FatalError` if an error is intentional and should not be retried.\n\nWe'll dive deeper into workflows, steps, and other ways to suspend or handle events in [Foundations](https://useworkflow.dev/docs/foundations).\n\n## [Create Your Route Handler](https://useworkflow.dev/docs/getting-started/sveltekit\\#create-your-route-handler)\n\nTo invoke your new workflow, we'll have to add your workflow to a `POST` API route handler, `src/routes/api/signup/+server.ts` with the following code:\n\nsrc/routes/api/signup/+server.ts\n\n```\n\n```\n\nThis route handler creates a `POST` request endpoint at `/api/signup` that will trigger your workflow.\n\nWorkflows can be triggered from API routes or any server-side code.\n\n## [Run in development](https://useworkflow.dev/docs/getting-started/sveltekit\\#run-in-development)\n\nTo start your development server, run the following command in your terminal in the SvelteKit root directory:\n\n```\nnpm run dev\n```\n\nOnce your development server is running, you can trigger your workflow by running this command in the terminal:\n\n```\ncurl -X POST --json '{\"email\":\"hello@example.com\"}' http://localhost:5173/api/signup\n```\n\nCheck the SvelteKit development server logs to see your workflow execute as well as the steps that are being processed.\n\nAdditionally, you can use the [Workflow DevKit CLI or Web UI](https://useworkflow.dev/docs/observability) to inspect your workflow runs and steps in detail.\n\n```\n# Open the observability Web UI\nnpx workflow web\n# or if you prefer a terminal interface, use the CLI inspect command\nnpx workflow inspect runs\n```\n\n![Workflow DevKit Web UI](https://useworkflow.dev/o11y-ui.png)\n\n## [Deploying to production](https://useworkflow.dev/docs/getting-started/sveltekit\\#deploying-to-production)\n\nWorkflow DevKit apps currently work best when deployed to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/home) and needs no special configuration.\n\nCheck the [Deploying](https://useworkflow.dev/docs/deploying) section to learn how your workflows can be deployed elsewhere.\n\n## [Next Steps](https://useworkflow.dev/docs/getting-started/sveltekit\\#next-steps)\n\n- Learn more about the [Foundations](https://useworkflow.dev/docs/foundations).\n- Check [Errors](https://useworkflow.dev/docs/errors) if you encounter issues.\n- Explore the [API Reference](https://useworkflow.dev/docs/api-reference).\n\n[Nuxt\\\\\n\\\\\nThis guide will walk through setting up your first workflow in a Nuxt app. Along the way, you'll learn more about the concepts that are fundamental to using the development kit in your own projects.](https://useworkflow.dev/docs/getting-started/nuxt) [Foundations\\\\\n\\\\\nNext Page](https://useworkflow.dev/docs/foundations)\n\nOn this page\n\n[Create Your SvelteKit Project](https://useworkflow.dev/docs/getting-started/sveltekit#create-your-sveltekit-project) [Install `workflow`](https://useworkflow.dev/docs/getting-started/sveltekit#install-workflow) [Configure Vite](https://useworkflow.dev/docs/getting-started/sveltekit#configure-vite) [Setup IntelliSense for TypeScript (Optional)](https://useworkflow.dev/docs/getting-started/sveltekit#setup-intellisense-for-typescript-optional) [Create Your First Workflow](https://useworkflow.dev/docs/getting-started/sveltekit#create-your-first-workflow) [Create Your Workflow Steps](https://useworkflow.dev/docs/getting-started/sveltekit#create-your-workflow-steps) [Create Your Route Handler](https://useworkflow.dev/docs/getting-started/sveltekit#create-your-route-handler) [Run in development](https://useworkflow.dev/docs/getting-started/sveltekit#run-in-development) [Deploying to production](https://useworkflow.dev/docs/getting-started/sveltekit#deploying-to-production) [Next Steps](https://useworkflow.dev/docs/getting-started/sveltekit#next-steps)\n\n[GitHubEdit this page on GitHub](https://github.com/vercel/workflow/edit/main/content/docs/getting-started/sveltekit.mdx) Scroll to topGive feedbackCopy pageAsk AI about this pageOpen in chat\n\n## Chat\n\nWhat is Workflow?How does retrying work?What control flow patterns are there?How do directives work?How do I build an AI agent?\n\nTip: You can open and close chat with `⌘I`\n\n0 / 1000",
